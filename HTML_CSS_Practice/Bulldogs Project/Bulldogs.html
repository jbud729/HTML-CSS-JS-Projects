    <h1>Origin</h1>
      <p>
        The Bulldog’s early history doesn’t provide many clues as to how this 
        beloved breed became such a popular family pet. According to the 
        American Kennel Club®, the Bulldog had its origin in the British Isles. 
        The name “bull” was applied because of the dog’s use in the sports of 
        bull-baiting and dog fighting. Bull-baiting was an especially cruel sport 
        where specially-bred Bulldogs were set loose on a tethered bull. 
        The dogs were trained to "play low," keeping their head close to 
        the ground in order to avoid being caught and thrown in the air by the 
        sharp tips of the bull’s horns. When a dog was able to grab the bull by the 
        nose and pin it to the ground, it was declared the winner.

    <h1>General Features of Bulldogs</h1>
      <p>
        Despite cartoon depictions of them as ferocious dogs, today's Bulldogs are bred to be affectionate and kind. They are, indeed, resolute and 
        courageous, but they aren't out to pick a fight. They often have a calm dignity about them when they are mature, and while they are friendly 
        and playful, they can be a bit stubborn and protective of their families. Bulldogs love people. They seek people out for 
        attention and enjoy nothing more than languishing next to their masters, and perhaps snoring while sleeping with their heads in their laps.
        Unfortunately, the Bulldog's unique body and head structure makes him prone to health problems, especially respiratory and joint difficulties. 
        They can quickly become overweight if they don't get enough exercise. Too much weight stresses their bodies and may aggravate existing health 
        problems.
